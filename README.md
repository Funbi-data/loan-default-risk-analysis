## 📌 Overview

Loan default is one of the major financial risks faced by banks and lending institutions. This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on customer information.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using FastAPI and Streamlit.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to assess the risk of loan default before approving loans.

Traditional manual assessment is often slow and inconsistent.

This project provides an AI-powered prediction system that helps estimate the likelihood of loan default using historical customer data.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The trained model predicts whether a customer is likely to default on a loan.

The preprocessing pipeline includes:

- Label Encoding
- Feature Transformation
- Model Serialization using Joblib

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|---------|------:|
| Accuracy | 83.08% |
| Precision | 24.93% |
| Recall | 22.71% |
| F1 Score | 23.77% |

The model was trained using Random Forest with SMOTE to address class imbalance. Since loan default prediction is an imbalanced classification problem, evaluation focused on precision, recall, and F1-score rather than accuracy alone.
